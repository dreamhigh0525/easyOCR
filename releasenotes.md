- 1 February 2021 - Version 1.2.3
    - Add `setLanguageList` method to `Reader` class. This is a convenient api for changing languages (within the same model) after creating class instance.
    - Small change on text box merging. (thanks [z-pc](https://github.com/z-pc), see [PR](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR/pull/338))
    - [Basic Demo on website](https://www.jaided.ai/easyocr)
